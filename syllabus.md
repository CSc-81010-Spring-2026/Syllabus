## Course Description

This course is intended to be a survey on the fundamental concepts and principles that underlie current and emerging methods, tools, and techniques for the design and implementation of modern programming languages. This includes the understanding and appreciation of topics in designing and implementing modern programming languages such as attribute grammars, operational semantics, (static and dynamic) type systems, abstract interpretation, and language implementation via interpreters and compilers. We may also discuss programming language concepts for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) systems, possibly including how Large Language Models (LLMs) are influencing the theory and practice of programming language design and implementation.

## Topics

Please note that this schedule is tentative:

- Attribute grammars 
- Operational semantics 
- Abstract interpretation
- Type systems
- Control-flow analysis
- Data-flow analysis
- Compiler optimizations
- Programming language concepts for Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) systems.

## Suggested Previous Courses and Knowledge

- CSc 70010: Algorithms.
- Computer Theory or equivalent, including formal languages and grammars.
- An undergraduate course in programming languages.
- Programming experience in an imperative and Object-Oriented, high-level language (e.g., C++, Java, Python).

## Homework

The course will include several written assignments and programming projects. Each will be assigned in Blackboard along with submission instructions. Assignments will be uploaded to Blackboard and the programming projects will be pushed to GitHub classroom. The exact instructions will follow. The projects must include command-line instructions on how to run the program.

### Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for assignments will be assigned in class.
- **Late assignments will be penalized.**
- No extensions will be given for extra credit assignments, if applicable.
- Assignments must result from **individual** effort unless otherwise noted (e.g., group projects).

## Exams

Test make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the test, and
- the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected for class meetings. Student are responsible for obtaining and covering any material missed due to absence.

## Academic Violations

The classroom environment employed will be that of a professional one. While students may discuss course materials and assignments with others, any submitted work in this course must be the result of *individual* effort *only*. Students are *strongly* advised to read the following resources regarding academic integrity:

- [Student Handbook](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/student-handbook)
- [Avoiding and Detecting Plagiarism](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/AvoidingPlagiarism.pdf)
- [Academic Honesty](https://gc.catalog.cuny.edu/general-information/academic-honesty)
- [Academic Integrity](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy)

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person once a week. See Bb for details. Attending office hours is optional, no appointment is necessary, and appointments cannot be made during office hours. Students should arrange an alternative meeting time if the scheduled office hours conflict with their schedules.

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY GC email address for FERPA reasons. Please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the [CUNY Blackboard][Blackboard].

## Bulletin Board

Students should check the [Brightspace site][Brightspace]{target="_blank"} regularly for class materials. Students should ensure that they have configured Brightspace to use a *CUNY* email address. Students are responsible for any email the instructor send there.
