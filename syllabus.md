## Course Description

This course delves into the theory and practical application of modern compiler construction. We will survey a range of topics, from fundamental concepts like lexical and syntax analysis to more advanced subjects such as code optimization and type systems. Other key areas of study will include intermediate code generation, control-flow and data-flow analysis. We will explore these topics through the lens of emerging methods, tools, and techniques in compiler design and implementation. Students will engage in a series of practical programming projects designed to illustrate the implementation details of various compiler components. We may also discuss, time permitting, specialized compilers, such as those for Deep Learning (DL) systems, and how Large Language Models (LLMs) are influencing the theory and practice of compiler construction.

## Potential Topics

- Lexical analysis and lexer generation (e.g., Lex/Flex)
- Syntax analysis and parser generation (e.g., Yacc/Bison)
- Semantic analysis and type checking
- Intermediate code generation (e.g., three-address code)
- Control-flow and data-flow analysis
- Code optimization techniques
- Machine code generation
- Run-time environments
- Advanced topics (e.g., compilers for Deep Learning [DL], JIT compilation, LLMs in compiler construction)

## Suggested Previous Courses and Knowledge

- CSc 70010: Algorithms.
- Computer Theory or equivalent, including formal languages and grammars.
- An undergraduate course in programming languages or compiler construction.
- Programming experience in an imperative and Object-Oriented, high-level language (e.g., C++, Java, Python).

## Textbooks and Materials

While there are no required texts, there are readings from the books listed below. All books are available at the library, and I have put them [on reserve][reserve] (please see Brightspace for the password). They are also available for purchase [online][bookstore]. I also have a (signed :)) copy of "Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools (2nd ed., commonly known as the "Dragon Book") in my office at Hunter College if you would like to borrow it.

## Learning Goals

- Understand the major phases of a modern compiler, including lexical analysis, parsing, semantic analysis, and machine code generation.
- Be able to use compiler construction tools, such as lexer and parser generators.
- Be able to implement key compiler components, such as a type checker, an intermediate code generator, and a register allocator.
- Understand and apply common code optimization techniques, including those based on control-flow and data-flow analysis, and techniques for exploiting parallelism and locality.
- Analyze the trade-offs between different compiler design choices.
- Explore advanced topics such as JIT compilation, and the influence of LLMs on compiler construction (time permitting).

## Projects

The course will include several programming projects. Each will be assigned in Brightspace along with submission instructions. Projects will be pushed to GitHub Classroom. The exact instructions will follow.

### Notes

- **Deadlines** and **due dates** for all projects will be announced in class.
- **Late submissions will be penalized.**
- Extensions for extra credit assignments, if applicable, will not be granted.
- Assignments must result from **individual** effort unless otherwise specified (e.g., group projects).

## Quizzes

Quiz make-ups will be given if and only if:

- the request is made sufficiently in advance of the quiz, and
- the make-up is scheduled prior to the next class.

## Attendance

Attendance is expected for class meetings. Student are responsible for obtaining and covering any material missed due to absence.

## Academic Integrity

The classroom environment employed will be that of a professional one. While students may discuss course materials and assignments with others, any submitted work in this course must be the result of *individual* effort *only*. Students are *strongly* advised to read the following resources regarding academic integrity:

- [Student Handbook](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/student-handbook)
- [Avoiding and Detecting Plagiarism](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/sites/default/files/2021-07/AvoidingPlagiarism.pdf)
- [Academic Honesty](https://gc.catalog.cuny.edu/general-information/academic-honesty)
- [Academic Integrity](https://www.cuny.edu/about/administration/offices/legal-affairs/policies-resources/academic-integrity-policy)

## Office Hours

Office hours will be held in person once a week. Attending office hours is optional, no appointment is necessary, and appointments cannot be made during office hours. Students should arrange an alternative meeting time if the scheduled office hours conflict with their schedules.

## Email

Emails to the instructor must be via a CUNY GC email address for FERPA reasons. Please ensure that your *correct* email address is entered into the [CUNY Brightspace][Brightspace].

## Bulletin Board

Students should check the [Brightspace site][Brightspace] regularly for class materials. Students should ensure that they have configured Brightspace to use a *CUNY* email address. Students are responsible for any email the instructor send there.

## Counseling & Wellness Services

The Wellness Center Student Counseling Services offers short-term individual and group counseling and psychotherapy, couples counseling, consultation and referral services, and various programs and workshops relevant to graduate student life. More information can be found on the [Counseling Services website](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Prospective-Current-Students/Student-Life/Health-Wellness/Counseling-Services).
